# ClickbaitPhenomenon_US-YoutubeVideos
The dataset Trending Youtube Video Statistics was found on kaggle (URL:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new). This dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Many countries were included in this dataset and we chose US as our research target. Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.

We’ve all seen it, and probably most of us have fallen for it – those headlines that scream that “You’ll never guess what XXX did” or “This will blow your mind”. In the online industry, these headlines are called Clickbait, a baiting headline designed to trigger an emotional response that urges you to click through to see what’s next.

In this project, we are interested in whether there is Clickbait phenomenon between video title and its view count and we want to figure out whether the model could learn the pattern of catchy titles and subsequently predict the view counts. To achieve our goal, we use the pre-trained model Glove and did some experiments to find the best model with different combinations of building layers. At the end, we use the trained-model to predict sentences that are considered to be clickbait titles from online resources and give a observable conclusion on the basis of the result.
